        <h2>Research Hypothesis</h2>

            <p>If we look at the change in tone and text of reviews from when the particular film was originally released in the context of the tensions that had arisen in 1992, 2014, and 2020, and how the tone has shifted based on those three inciting incidents, then we will have evidence of the poignant shift in opinions, based on the popular attitudes of the time.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="data-and-methods">
        
        <h2>Data and Methods</h2>

            <p>All of our data sets came from scrapes of the film's reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The methods we used include VADER sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of the reviews over time, and term frequency analysis to analyze what the majority of reviewers were focused on. In order to make this accurate, we utilized code from previous homeworks with some alterations.</p>

Martin Luther King Jr. condemned violence but emphasized the environmental causes: unemployment, housing neglect, economic exclusion, and police hostility. He traveled to Watts despite political pressure not to, aiming to support residents and advocate for structural reform. The Watts uprising reveals a pattern that echoes across cities—including Ferguson—in which policing events ignite deeper frustrations rooted in systemic inequality.</p>

                            <p class="info">Mississippi becomes the last state to officially ratify the amendment abolishing slavery. Although slavery had long been outlawed, the ratification was delayed due to an administrative oversight from 1995. A pair of researchers uncovered the mistake after seeing Spielberg’s Lincoln, prompting the correction. Symbolically, this shows how vestiges of slavery—and institutional resistance to racial progress—persist well into the 21st century.</p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>

            <h3>Rodney King Riots (1992)</h3>

            <p>Rodney King was pulled over for speeding, led to an 8 mile car chase.

            “When the officers’ initial efforts to bring a noncompliant King to the ground failed, they clubbed him with their batons dozens of times. The videotape, which was broadcast across the United States, prompted a huge outpouring of protest.”
            
            April 29, 1992 the officers were acquitted of the charges, erupting in protests

            At the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues, in predominantly Black South Central Los Angeles—not far from Watts, where large-scale rioting had resulted in 34 deaths in 1965—a growing crowd began harassing motorists. 

            Rodeny spoke on television during the riots saying “Can’t we get along?”

            Bush dispatched 3.000-4,000 troops to help quell the riots.

            “It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today.”

            Tensions were already high in south LA between Korean store owners and the neighboring Black community. 

            A Korean store owner in South Los Angeles shot and killed a 15-year-old African-American girl named Latasha Harlins, who was accused of trying to steal orange juice. It was later discovered Harlins was clutching money to pay for the juice when she was killed. The store owner received probation and a $500 fine.

            This heightened tensions against police officers, with many African Americans reported not feeling protected by the LAPD and being harassed without cause

            During the five days of unrest, there were more than 50 riot-related deaths — including 10 people who were shot and killed by LAPD officers and National Guardsmen. More than 2,000 people were injured, and nearly 6,000 alleged looters and arsonists were arrested.</p>

            <h3>Ferguson Unrest (2014-2015)</h3>

            <p>“The police claimed that Brown was a suspect in a nearby store robbery and that the items had been spotted in his possession, prompting their action.  Some witnesses said that Brown put his hands up and others said that he ran for his life.  The conflicting accounts were the subject of much controversy in the following days.”

            “Minutes later 18-year-old Mr Brown was dead, suffering at least seven gunshot wounds, according to county prosecutor Bob McCulloch. His body lay in the street for four hours before it was removed.”

            “Mr Wilson fired a total of 12 bullets, though investigators were unclear exactly how many of the 12 struck Mr Brown. One injury may have been a re-entry wound.”

            Mr Crump (Brown's lawyer) also identified what he said were inconsistencies in the officer's evidence and condemned the "symbiotic relationship" between prosecutor Mr McCulloch and the local police force. Critics of Mr McCulloch have also expressed concern about his impartiality. His father, a police officer, was shot dead by a black man in the 1960s.</p>

            <h3>George Floyd Protests (2020)</h3>

            <p>George Floyd was murdered by police on May 25, 2020. Police officers handcuffed him, pinned him to the ground, and officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, ending his life. A video of the incident quickly went viral and sparked what scholars have called, “the largest episode of social protest in both the catalogue of the BLM movement and the longer history of Black resistance against dehumanization and state violence in the U.S.” (Cambridge)

            By the first week of June 2020, protests had occurred in over 140 cities across the United States and extended to over 40 countries (Smith, Wu, and Murphy Reference Smith, Wu and Murphy2020). The 2020 BLM protests were tonally radical, pushing the language of abolition into the mainstream and redefining the discourse around policing. (Annual review)</p>

            <h3>Global Perspective</h3>

            <h4>United Kingdom</h4>

                <p>Recorded the largest BLM protests outside the U.S. post George FloydEven before, local incidents had already sparked discontent. Talked on Belly Mujinga: a Black transport worker who died from racist attack/covid exposure
                The protests showed solidarity with the U.S. to confront history and  domestic issues of racism
                Statues of slave traders and controversial national figures were vandalised or removed 
                EX: Winston Churchill statue was spray-painted). 
                Gov. commissioned a report on race and ethnicity and introduced legislation giving police greater powers to restrict protests
                Triggered further protest like “Kill the Bill” 
                Protesters did not like their outcome</p>

            <h4>New Zealand</h4>
                <p>George Floyd’s death started a new wave of activism among Black, “Māori and Pacific people”. Historically have liked being known as “peaceful” 
                Protesters challenged previously less-spoken-about issues of race and discrimination: 
                “Imagine you are Black, but you’re not allowed to be Black.” 
                The protests coincided with a government trial-run of arming police and other violence and protesters demanded that the plan be cancelled and it was
                A cross-community movement emerged, with Black protesters with Māori and Pacific Islanders 
                This marked a new kind of coalition </p>

            <h4>France</h4>
                <p>In France, the movement was tied to the country’s colonial history and racialised immigration from former French colonies. 
                Protesters linked Floyd’s death with domestic cases like that of Adama T. who died in police custody in 2016. 
                Arguments about the history of slavery and colonization are still present today and need more public atten.
                Paris protests featured both solidarity with the MN event and focus on France’s personal systemic issues of policing and race.</p>

            <h4>Colombia</h4>
                <p>The death occurred at same time as  domestic police killings of Black or Afro-Colombian men
                Names Anderson Arboleda, Javier Ordonez). 
                Encouraged people to record instances of police violence on video and come together in crowds in person 
                Protests were intense and some deadly
                Dozens of protest-related deaths at the hands of police (at least 43) and thousands of reports of police brutality. 

            <h4>Washington, D.C.</h4>
                <p>Large gatherings, and the creation of a dedicated protest space 
                Creation of the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House (trump has now gotten rid of it) 
                Drew global attention with police/national guard tear-gassed peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square early June so Trump could pose with a Bible
                This drew riot across the political spectrum. 
                Mutual-aid initiatives in all 8 wards were launched post death and protests
                Many still say institutional change remains lacking.</p>

        <h3>📐 Classification Logic</h3>
        <p>This project reveals how <strong>algorithmic sentiment analysis</strong>
        imposes categorical boundaries on human emotion. VADER's compound score
        reduces complex cultural expressions to a single number between -1 and +1.</p>

        <p>Question to consider: <em>What nuances are lost when we classify
        sentiment as simply "positive," "negative," or "neutral"?</em></p>

        <h3>🤖 AI Agency</h3>
        <p>Topic modeling with LDA appears to "discover" themes in text,
        creating an illusion of <strong>machine intelligence</strong>.
        However, the algorithm simply identifies statistical word co-occurrences—
        the interpretation and meaning-making is entirely human.</p>
