        <h2>Research Hypothesis</h2>

            <p>If we look at the change in tone and text of reviews from when the particular film was originally released in the context of the tensions that had arisen in 1992, 2014, and 2020, and how the tone has shifted based on those three inciting incidents, then we will have evidence of the poignant shift in opinions, based on the popular attitudes of the time.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="methods">
        
        <h2>Methods</h2>

            <p>To investigate how audience attitudes toward race-oriented films have evolved over the last fifteen years, our project employed a mixed-methods approach combining computational text analysis with close interpretive reading. Our dataset consisted of publicly available viewer reviews scraped from online platforms, primarily using automated web-scraping tools to collect full-text reviews for “Do the Right Thing,” “Selma,” “The Help,” “The Blind Side,” “Hidden Figures,” and “The Hate U Give.” We selected these six films because they span a fifteen-year period, vary in genre and historical focus, and collectively reflect major shifts in public discourse on race, representation, and social justice.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        
            <p>Using website scraping tools, we extracted all accessible user reviews that met minimum length requirements to ensure substantive content. Metadata fields (such as date, user rating, and username) were collected when available but excluded from analysis to protect privacy and maintain focus on textual patterns. In total, our data consisted of several thousand individual reviews. After scraping, we performed cleaning procedures including correcting encoding errors, and filtering out non-English text. Stopwords were selectively removed for certain analyses but retained for sentiment scoring, as negations (“not,” “never”) and intensifiers are important emotional markers.</p>
                
            <p>The computational methods used included term-frequency analysis, sentiment scoring, and close reading of extreme scores. Term-frequency helped identify which characters, ideas, and historical references appeared most often; sentiment analysis allowed us to measure the emotional tone of reviews; and close reading enabled us to assess the context of the reviews and what changed pre- and post-2020 where timestamps were available. While not all reviews included explicit dates, Rotten Tomatoes (our primary space for collecting data) maintained chronological order, allowing for approximate alignment with cultural context and contemporary discourse.</p>

        <h3>Analytical Approach</h3>

        <p>Our analysis was structured around three central questions:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Who and what do reviewers talk about most often? (term frequency)</li>
                <li>How do reviewers feel about the films? (sentiment analysis)</li>
                <li>What were the topics and context of extreme positive and negative reviews, and the shift over time, especially after 2020? (keyword and discourse comparison)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After generating term-frequency lists, we examined the top twenty terms for each film and interpreted their narrative and cultural significance. Sentiment analysis was performed using VADR tool that assigns numerical emotional values to each sentence and then averages them across the data sets.</p>

            <p>This computational layer was paired with close readings of the most positive or negative reviews, to contextualize the quantitative findings. This step was essential, as sentiment scores alone cannot explain why a review is positive or how historical references are being used.</p>

        <h3>Limitations and Data Quality</h3>

            <p>Our methods come with several limitations. First, online reviews are self-selected data: individuals motivated to write reviews may hold stronger opinions than the average viewer. Second, review platforms differ in audience demographics, which may skew tone or vocabulary. A third limitation involves time-stamping: not all reviews indicate when they were written, which affects our ability to precisely measure pre- versus post-2020 shifts. Finally, sentiment tools can misinterpret sarcasm, mixed emotions, or culturally specific language, leading to scores that flatten nuance.</p>

            <p>Data quality also varies significantly by film. Older films like "Do the Right Thing" have reviews written years after release, reflecting retrospective rather than immediate reactions. Newer films have more immediate responses influenced by contemporary political climates. Despite these limitations, the consistency of thematic patterns across platforms and films suggests that the dataset is robust enough to reveal meaningful trends.</p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>

            <h3>Rodney King Riots (1992)</h3>

            <p>Rodney King was pulled over for speeding, leading to an 8-mile car chase. When the officers’ initial efforts to bring a noncompliant King to the ground failed, they clubbed him with their batons dozens of times. The videotape, which was broadcast nationwide, prompted a massive outpouring of protest. On April 29, 1992, the officers were acquitted of the charges, erupting in protests. At the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues, in predominantly Black South Central Los Angeles—not far from Watts, where large-scale rioting had resulted in 34 deaths in 1965—a growing crowd began harassing motorists. Rodney spoke on television during the riots, saying, “Can’t we get along?”</p>
            
            <p>President Bush dispatched 3,000 to 4,000 troops. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today. Tensions were already high in South LA between Korean store owners and the neighbouring Black community. A Korean store owner in South Los Angeles shot and killed a 15-year-old African-American girl named Latasha Harlins, who was accused of trying to steal orange juice. It was later discovered that Harlins was clutching money to pay for the juice when she was killed. The store owner received probation and a $500 fine. This heightened tensions against police officers, with many African Americans reporting not feeling protected by the LAPD and being harassed without cause. During the five days of unrest, there were more than 50 riot-related deaths, including 10 people who were shot and killed by LAPD officers and National Guardsmen. More than 2,000 people were injured, and nearly 6,000 alleged looters and arsonists were arrested.</p>

            <img src="images/background/freeway-closure-rodney-king.png" alt="Rodney King Riots Freeway Closure Photograph" width="100%">

            <h3>Ferguson Unrest (2014-2015)</h3>

            <p>The unrest in Ferguson began after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014. According to police, Brown was suspected of involvement in a nearby convenience store robbery, and officers claimed that stolen items were found in his possession. However, eyewitness accounts of the shooting contradicted this claim. Some witnesses reported that Brown had his hands raised in a gesture of surrender, while others stated that he was attempting to flee. These opposing narratives became a central point of controversy in the days following the incident.</p>

            <p>County prosecutor Bob McCulloch later reported that Brown suffered at least seven gunshot wounds, and Wilson ultimately fired 12 shots, with one injury possibly resulting from a re-entry wound. Brown’s body remained in the street for approximately four hours after the shooting—an event that community members cited as emblematic of deep disrespect and dehumanization.</p>

            <p>Concerns about bias within the investigation also quickly emerged. Benjamin Crump, the Brown family’s attorney, identified multiple inconsistencies in Officer Wilson’s testimony and criticized what he described as a “symbiotic relationship” between McCulloch’s office and the local police department. Critics also questioned McCulloch’s impartiality, noting that his father, a police officer, had been killed by a Black man decades earlier. These details contributed to broader public doubts about the fairness of the grand jury proceedings and the transparency of the justice system in St. Louis County.</p>

            <p>A BBC report published ten years after the unrest provides additional context, highlighting long-standing tensions between the police and Ferguson residents as well as the community’s evolving perspectives in the decade since the shooting. Interviews with local community members reflect both progress and ongoing challenges, emphasizing how structural inequalities, racial bias, and distrust in law enforcement shaped the conditions that led to the protests.</p>

            <h3>George Floyd Protests (2020)</h3>

            <p>George Floyd was murdered by police on May 25, 2020. Police officers handcuffed him, pinned him to the ground, and officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, ending his life. A video of the incident quickly went viral and sparked what scholars have called, “the largest episode of social protest in both the catalogue of the BLM movement and the longer history of Black resistance against dehumanization and state violence in the U.S.” (Cambridge)</p>

            <p>By the first week of June 2020, protests had occurred in over 140 cities across the United States and extended to over 40 countries (Smith, Wu, and Murphy Reference Smith, Wu and Murphy2020). The 2020 BLM protests were tonally radical, pushing the language of abolition into the mainstream and redefining the discourse around policing. (Annual review)</p>

            <h3>Global Perspective</h3>

            <h4>United Kingdom</h4>

                <p>Recorded the largest BLM protests outside the U.S. post George FloydEven before, local incidents had already sparked discontent. Talked on Belly Mujinga: a Black transport worker who died from racist attack/covid exposure
                The protests showed solidarity with the U.S. to confront history and  domestic issues of racism
                Statues of slave traders and controversial national figures were vandalised or removed 
                EX: Winston Churchill statue was spray-painted). 
                Gov. commissioned a report on race and ethnicity and introduced legislation giving police greater powers to restrict protests
                Triggered further protest like “Kill the Bill” 
                Protesters did not like their outcome</p>

            <h4>New Zealand</h4>
                <p>George Floyd’s death started a new wave of activism among Black, “Māori and Pacific people”. Historically have liked being known as “peaceful” 
                Protesters challenged previously less-spoken-about issues of race and discrimination: 
                “Imagine you are Black, but you’re not allowed to be Black.” 
                The protests coincided with a government trial-run of arming police and other violence and protesters demanded that the plan be cancelled and it was
                A cross-community movement emerged, with Black protesters with Māori and Pacific Islanders 
                This marked a new kind of coalition </p>

            <h4>France</h4>
                <p>In France, the movement was tied to the country’s colonial history and racialised immigration from former French colonies. 
                Protesters linked Floyd’s death with domestic cases like that of Adama T. who died in police custody in 2016. 
                Arguments about the history of slavery and colonization are still present today and need more public atten.
                Paris protests featured both solidarity with the MN event and focus on France’s personal systemic issues of policing and race.</p>

            <h4>Colombia</h4>
                <p>The death occurred at same time as  domestic police killings of Black or Afro-Colombian men
                Names Anderson Arboleda, Javier Ordonez). 
                Encouraged people to record instances of police violence on video and come together in crowds in person 
                Protests were intense and some deadly
                Dozens of protest-related deaths at the hands of police (at least 43) and thousands of reports of police brutality. 

            <h4>Washington, D.C.</h4>
                <p>Large gatherings, and the creation of a dedicated protest space 
                Creation of the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House (trump has now gotten rid of it) 
                Drew global attention with police/national guard tear-gassed peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square early June so Trump could pose with a Bible
                This drew riot across the political spectrum. 
                Mutual-aid initiatives in all 8 wards were launched post death and protests
                Many still say institutional change remains lacking.</p>

            <p>Our analysis of sentiment scores, term frequency, and review content across six films—”Do the Right Thing “(1989), “The Help” (2011), “Selma” (2014), “The Blind Side” (2009), “Hidden Figures”(2016), and “The Hate U Give” (2018), reveals a significant evolution in how audiences engage with narratives about race. The data shows a clear progression from polarized or superficial reactions toward sophisticated, critically informed engagement. These shifts reflect broader cultural changes, particularly following increased civil rights activism around 2020.</p>

        <h3>Term Frequency</h3>
        
            <p>Through our analysis of term frequency across six selected films three major themes emerged: a strong focus on characters and history as central "characters" themselves, consistent attention to key actors and figures, and clear repetition patterns that reveal what viewers care about most. It is clear from reviewers' comments that many of the responses are reflective of the broader social issues present in the cultural climate of the time.</p>

            <p>The first major theme we identified is how the data reflects character-centered priorities, especially around main characters, executive producers, and lead actors. In each of our six movies, lead characters and actor names made the top 20 list. A striking pattern in these reviews is how much actor choice influences audience reception and shapes the conversation around these films. In films such as “The Help,” we identified that the attention on Emma Stone suggests a limited understanding of the Black experience, because viewers were more focused on her than on the actual stories of Black women.</p>

            <p>A similar pattern can be seen in reviews for “The Blind Side,” where Sandra Bullock received significantly more praise than the film's themes, message, and overall narrative choices. These patterns reinforce the idea that when films deal with race, audiences respond first to the individuals embodying those racial tensions.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Another unique pattern we identified is how integrated historical references are across all datasets. This pattern tells us that audiences aren't watching these films, they're viewing them as representations of something bigger, actively bringing historical awareness into their writing. It is also important to note that the way reviewers discuss history varies depending on the film, revealing not only audience priorities but also the broader social, political, and cultural conversations happening at the time each movie was released.</p>

            <p>Across the films, reviewers consistently anchor their opinions in the historical contexts presented in each film. For “Selma,” terms that made the top 20 were: rights, civil, history, people, King, Jr., Martin, Luther. This shows that reviewers focus on accuracy, legacy, and the emotional weight carried by Dr. King's story.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>“The Help” also provides a strong example of how reviewers treat history as an active force. Terms like book, white, black, and story show that viewers weren't just thinking about the narrative; they were thinking about the 1960s Civil Rights era and how the film chose to present that moment. What differed from “Selma,” was that many reviews reflected frustration with whose perspective was centered (Skeeter's), revealing that audiences were evaluating not just accuracy but ownership: who gets to tell historical stories of racism? “The Help” sparked conversations about whether the film honored or diluted the realities of Black domestic workers and how the narrative was represented through a modern lens. Overall, these patterns revealed that reviewers treat these movies as cultural documents, and their language mirrors the racial conversations and awareness levels of their respective release periods.</p>

            <p>Finally, the words that repeat—and the ones that don't—reveal the strongest audience priorities. “The Blind Side” contains few identity-based terms, suggesting that reviewers largely avoided explicitly discussing race. “Hidden Figures” reviews show audiences directly named race and identity, indicating a shift toward openly acknowledging representation. Further, we see this with this in “Do the Right Thing.” Terms like racial, racism, black, people, and neighborhood appear repeatedly. Reviewers emphasize these themes because the film is an unfiltered depiction of escalating racial tension, police violence, and community anger. Unlike earlier films where race language is softened or avoided, here we see explicit naming of racism, identity, and violence. By the time reviewers discuss “The Hate U Give,” this kind of explicit vocabulary becomes even more common, showing a continued cultural shift toward naming racial issues directly rather than talking around them.</p>

            <p>The term-frequency patterns provide a clear timeline of how audiences have talked about race on screen over the last 15 years. Reviewers' language shows how their priorities changed over time—from valuing a "good story," to honoring "powerful history," to finally seeking accurate visibility for overlooked communities.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Comparing how reviewers discuss characters, race, performance, story ownership, and thematic impact across these films reinforces one major insight: audience attitudes toward racial narratives have significantly evolved, especially in the wake of increased civil-rights activism around 2020. Reviewers have become more socially aware, more critical of who is centered, and more attentive to the politics of representation—not just what stories are told, but who gets to tell them.</p>
