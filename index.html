        <h2>Research Question</h2>

            <p>If we look at the change in tone and text of reviews from when the particular film was originally released in the context of the tensions that had arisen in 1992, 2014, and 2020, and how the tone has shifted based on those three inciting incidents, then we will have evidence of the poignant shift in opinions, based on the popular attitudes of the time.</p>

        <h2>Data and Methods</h2>

            <p>All of our data sets came from scrapes of the film's reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The methods we used include VADER sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of the reviews over time, and term frequency analysis to analyze what the majority of reviewers were focused on. In order to make this accurate, we utilized code from previous homeworks with some alterations.</p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>

            <h3>Rodney King Riots (1992)</h3>

            <p>Rodney King was pulled over for speeding, led to an 8 mile car chase.

            “When the officers’ initial efforts to bring a noncompliant King to the ground failed, they clubbed him with their batons dozens of times. The videotape, which was broadcast across the United States, prompted a huge outpouring of protest.”
            
            April 29, 1992 the officers were acquitted of the charges, erupting in protests

            At the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues, in predominantly Black South Central Los Angeles—not far from Watts, where large-scale rioting had resulted in 34 deaths in 1965—a growing crowd began harassing motorists. 

            Rodeny spoke on television during the riots saying “Can’t we get along?”

            Bush dispatched 3.000-4,000 troops to help quell the riots.

            “It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today.”

            Tensions were already high in south LA between Korean store owners and the neighboring Black community. 

            A Korean store owner in South Los Angeles shot and killed a 15-year-old African-American girl named Latasha Harlins, who was accused of trying to steal orange juice. It was later discovered Harlins was clutching money to pay for the juice when she was killed. The store owner received probation and a $500 fine.

            This heightened tensions against police officers, with many African Americans reported not feeling protected by the LAPD and being harassed without cause

            During the five days of unrest, there were more than 50 riot-related deaths — including 10 people who were shot and killed by LAPD officers and National Guardsmen. More than 2,000 people were injured, and nearly 6,000 alleged looters and arsonists were arrested.</p>

            <h3>Ferguson Unrest (2014-2015)</h3>

            <p>“The police claimed that Brown was a suspect in a nearby store robbery and that the items had been spotted in his possession, prompting their action.  Some witnesses said that Brown put his hands up and others said that he ran for his life.  The conflicting accounts were the subject of much controversy in the following days.”

            “Minutes later 18-year-old Mr Brown was dead, suffering at least seven gunshot wounds, according to county prosecutor Bob McCulloch. His body lay in the street for four hours before it was removed.”

            “Mr Wilson fired a total of 12 bullets, though investigators were unclear exactly how many of the 12 struck Mr Brown. One injury may have been a re-entry wound.”

            Mr Crump (Brown's lawyer) also identified what he said were inconsistencies in the officer's evidence and condemned the "symbiotic relationship" between prosecutor Mr McCulloch and the local police force. Critics of Mr McCulloch have also expressed concern about his impartiality. His father, a police officer, was shot dead by a black man in the 1960s.</p>

            <h3>George Floyd Protests (2020)</h3>

    <h2>Analysis Process</h2>
    <p>I used the <code>vaderSentiment</code> library to analyze tweet sentiment:</p>

    <div class="code-title">sentiment_analysis.py</div>
    <pre><code>from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

for tweet in tweets:
    scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet)
    print(f"Compound score: {scores['compound']}")</code></pre>

    <p>The compound score ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).</p>

    <div class="framework-callout">
        <h3>📐 Classification Logic</h3>
        <p>This project reveals how <strong>algorithmic sentiment analysis</strong>
        imposes categorical boundaries on human emotion. VADER's compound score
        reduces complex cultural expressions to a single number between -1 and +1.</p>

        <p>Question to consider: <em>What nuances are lost when we classify
        sentiment as simply "positive," "negative," or "neutral"?</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="framework-callout">
        <h3>🤖 AI Agency</h3>
        <p>Topic modeling with LDA appears to "discover" themes in text,
        creating an illusion of <strong>machine intelligence</strong>.
        However, the algorithm simply identifies statistical word co-occurrences—
        the interpretation and meaning-making is entirely human.</p>
